---------------- 1.3 Released -- [06-Apr-2006 15:29 GMT+7] ------------------

 ^ Query database for menu items only one time per page load then store the
results found in global object $mainframe of Joomla. This reduces the number
of SQL query executions and speeds up the page load when there are more than
one instance of D4J TransMenu module configured to show in the same page.
=> special thanks to Mr. Rey Gigataras [stingrey] from the Joomla! Core Team
for this solution.

 + Added support for displaying separator (either string of characters or
image) between root-level menu items.

 + Added ability to turn on/off Separator/Placeholder menu item.

 # Bug fixed: Separator/Placeholder menu item becomes hyper-linked which
cause error when visitor click on.

 # Bug fixed: Wrong address for Link - URL menu item when SEF is turned on.
