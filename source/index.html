      <h3>Left Column</h3>
      <p>Secondary links, news updates, pointless rants or images can fill this
        column.</p>
      <p>The border to the right is assigned to the <a href="#">center</a> column
        and will expand with content over there. You can move it to this colum
        or give it the axe. Decisions, decisions. </p>
      <h3>Style Sheets</h3>
      <p>Seperate style sheets for both print and handheld devices are included
        with this design, so you'd be covered if/when someone visits your site
        on their cell phone or what-not.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="center_column">
      <div class="box_right">
        <h3>Faux Column</h3>
        <p>This isn't a column but a handy little text box with a float:right
          slapped on it.</p>
        <p>Could be used for a profile, secondary links or what ever else rocks
          your world.</p>
        <h3>Damn You IE!</h3>
        <p>Is common sense dead? And if it is, was Microsoft the ones that killed
          it? It never fails, learning about CSS is also learning about just
          how much of a pain in the ass IE can be.</p>
        <p>This is the first time that I used the <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Ten_CSS_tricks_you_may_not_know/17/60369/">!important</a> tag
          and it couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
        <p>Is it too much to ask that someday web designers won't have to rely
          on hacks so much? Damn I hope not.</p>

      <h2>Voodoo Dolly (v1.0)</h2>
      <p>What can i say? A two-column layout with fixed dimensions. Sure it's
        nothing that will take over the world or get women to talk to you, but
        it can serve as either a personal or commercial web site.</p>
      <p>Of course, out-of-the-box, this design can be applied to a site that
        has something to do with computers but by removing both the upper and
        lower logos, it can be used for anything really.</p>
      <p>The image below gives you an idea what the "bones" of this design looks
        like.</p>
      <p><img width="361" height="373" alt="layout diagram" src="img/layout.gif" /></p>
      <h2>Web Geek Stuff</h2>
      <p><em>Voodoo Dolly (v1.0)</em> was tested in Windows with Firefox1.0.7,
        IE6.0, Netscape7.2 and Opera7.54 with valid css and xhtml 1.0-strict.</p>
      <p>As is, download time for 56k is 5.76 seconds; ISDN 128K at 1.90 seconds;
        T1 at .35 seconds.</p>
      <p>All images weigh in at 19.5KB.</p>
